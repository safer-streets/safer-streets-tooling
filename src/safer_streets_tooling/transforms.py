"""
H3 aggregation transforms for the build pipeline.

These functions operate on an open, writable DuckDB connection that already
contains:
  - a ``crime_data`` table (street-level crimes with latitude/longitude/crime_type/month)
  - one boundary table per ONS geography (each with a ``spatial_id`` code and a BNG
    ``geom`` column), as written by ``scripts.ons_boundaries.load_all``.

They build, for each H3 resolution:
  - ``crime_counts_h3_{res}``           counts grouped by H3 cell / crime type / month
  - ``h3_{res}_{key}_lookup``           a view mapping each H3 cell to one ONS geography code
  - ``h3_{res}_{name}_lookup``          a view of every overlapping feature per cell (greenspace, land cover, roads)
  - ``h3_{res}_retail_centre_lookup``   a view of each cell's nearest retail centre (within a radius) + distance
  - ``h3_{res}_geogs``                  one row per H3 cell: ONS codes + overlap id lists + nearest retail centre

Ported from the ``duckdb-spatial`` prototype notebook (safer-streets-eda).
